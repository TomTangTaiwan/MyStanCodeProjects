    Lesson learnt:
    1. oval.x and oval.y only point at the top-left coordinate of the object. If the object is an oval, the coordinate
    is outside the oval, so the code can't locate the oval with window.get_object_at.
    So we need to add the radius to appointed coordinates to be on top of the oval.
